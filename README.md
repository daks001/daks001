## Hi, I'm Dakshika, and welcome to my GitHub :octocat:

I'm a sophomore at Texas A&M University, majoring in Computer Science! :woman_technologist: 

I've been exploring web development and simple game development through personal projects. I'm also interested in data science and machine learning, and have done research in these areas. 

This year, I'm working as the Google Developer Student Club Lead and the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador at Texas A&M University.
